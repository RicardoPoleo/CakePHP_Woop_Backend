Woop Backend/APIs
=======
[![CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/img/cake-logo.png)](http://www.cakephp.org)
----------------------------
The following code was developed for a company in Panama. It serves as a backend for an application of food classification and social network called "Woop". It is developed in PHP, using
a pattern of MVC development in conjunction with the CakePHP framework.

If you have used this framework before, you probably dont need any further induction code and feel free to travel around the app. Otherwise, I'll list you the main folders and what you can find in then:

The main folders (at least for the MVC) are:
--------------------------------------------
*[Controllers](https://github.com/RicardoPoleo/git-github.com-RicardoPoleo-WoopBackend/tree/master/app/Controller)

*[Models](https://github.com/RicardoPoleo/git-github.com-RicardoPoleo-WoopBackend/tree/master/app/Model)

*[Views](https://github.com/RicardoPoleo/git-github.com-RicardoPoleo-WoopBackend/tree/master/app/View)


This application is under development right now.
